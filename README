DESCRIPTION

This is a framework based on Mojo, with easy syntax
like Mojolicious::Lite, intended for making applications
which are part of an HTTP-based cluster.

When used with Rose::DB::Planter, Clustericious
allows for the easy conversion of a database
schema into a RESTful interface and a web
frontend.

EXAMPLE

Let's turn a database schema below into a RESTful
web service with a web front end.

Step 1.  Make your schema :

    create table artist (
        id integer primary key,
        name varchar
    );

    create table album (
        id integer primary key,
        artist integer references artist,
        title varchar,
        year integer
    );

    create table song (
        id integer primary key,
        album integer references album(id),
        title varchar,
        length integer
    );

    create table performance (
        id integer primary key,
        location varchar
    );

    create table song_performance (
        song integer references song(id),
        performance integer references performance (id),
        primary key (song, performance)
    );

Note we have several 1-many relationships and one
many-many relationship.
